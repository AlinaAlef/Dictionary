Enterprise Programming is when a programmer is hired to develop applications for a corporation or other large organization
whose primary business is NOT Software Development. Every industry employees thousands upon thousands of programmers to develop
both internal applications for use by employees and externally facing applications such as Web Applications for use by their customers.
In either case the software is specific to the organizationâ€™s business domain. Programmers may either be direct employees of the company
or they might work for a consultant firm who is hired by the company to develop software for their business requirements.
For example a Bank or Financial Services company will employ programmers to develop everything from Trading Systems to Reference Data
and Reporting applications. Manufacturing firms as another example, may hire programmers to develop Just In Time inventory supply chain
management applications.
Why do companies and other large organizations develop in-house software instead of simply buying software package from Software firms?
